Connection is a real-time, universal (60+ languages) translator, chat app. Users can speak and read messages in their own language with anybody else.

It uses Google Translate for the translations. And except for using a [personal framework](https://github.com/jacroe/scalene) all of it was written over the course of 48 hours for [Koding's](http://koding.com) Global Hackathon.
